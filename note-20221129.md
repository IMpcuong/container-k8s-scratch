1. `ADD` vs `RUN` keywords inside `Dockerfile` explication:

- `ADD` is executed in docker host.

  - The `ADD` instruction copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from \<src\> and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path \<dest\>.

- `RUN` is executed inside your container.

  - The `RUN` instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results.
  - The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the `Dockerfile`.

- Comparision between 2 commands:

  - Specifically the command `RUN curl -o file.txt http://X.X.X.X/path/to/file/file.txt` executes curl that must have already been installed in the image we are using.
  - If the `curl` command has not been installed (and is not present in the base image) the entire `RUN` command fails.
  - Instead the command `ADD curl -o file.txt http://X.X.X.X/path/to/file/file.txt` can be performed even without having installed `curl` (or analogues) inside the container just because it is executed by the host (it uses the Go libraries with which it is written docker) during the creation of our image.

- Question: Is http://X.X.X.X/path/to/file/file.txt accessible outside of your docker container? (From `stackoverflow`)

  - Context: My docker host lives behind a firewall that has a proxy set in the /etc/default/docker file.
    So while I wanted to grab a file internal to the network I'm on, the proxy caused it to look outside the network.

- Keywords specification:
